## Custom Instructions

**Mandatory Task Workflow:**

1.  After completing each task, immediately use `new_task("Start Task X: [Task Name] - [Detailed Description]")` to begin the next task in a new window. Always include a clear and detailed description (e.g., `new_task("Start Task 1: Project Setup - Initialize project and configure environment")`). Continuing in the current window is not allowed.
2.  Tasks must be executed sequentially as grouped and listed in `projectConfig.md`, following the defined flow (e.g., Foundation, Database, Backend, Frontend).
3.  After completing tasks that affect the project’s structure (e.g., database changes, new APIs), **immediately update the highly detailed Mermaid diagrams in `projectConfig.md`** to reflect the current state using tools like `write_to_file` or `insert_content`.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Commit changes after each task with a message like `[Task X]: Description`. Version control is crucial for tracking progress and managing changes.

**Project Context & Memory Management:**

*   `projectConfig.md` is **the single, highly detailed source of truth** and the central memory bank for project knowledge. **It must include everything relevant to the project, such as directory structure, Mermaid diagrams, tech stack details, and task breakdowns.** All project details, guidelines, tasks, and diagrams are stored and meticulously maintained in this file.
*   Read `projectConfig.md` **entirely and carefully** at the start of every session and task to understand the full scope, guidelines, flow, and current diagrams. **Ensure you are aware of all details within `projectConfig.md` before proceeding.**
*   All files, including `projectConfig.md` and `projectBrief.md`, reside in the root directory. Use relative paths from the root.
*   If commands like `npx create-react-app .` create new directories (e.g., `./src`), immediately update `projectConfig.md` with the new structure and adjust all paths accordingly.
*   When using multiple commands to be executed in the terminal, present them all in a single line (e.g., 'command1 && command2')

**projectConfig.md Structure:** (No changes to structure itself, just emphasizing detail in description)

1.  **Project Overview:** High-level description of the project, its goals, and key features. **Ensure this section is detailed enough to provide a complete understanding of the project's purpose.**
2.  **Architecture:** Define the system architecture (e.g., microservices, monolithic MVC). Include a **highly detailed** Architecture Diagram (Mermaid).
3.  **Tech Stack:** **Provide a detailed list** of technologies, frameworks, and libraries, including versions (e.g., Node.js 18, React 18, PostgreSQL 15).
4.  **UI/UX Guidelines:** Define design principles, component libraries (e.g., Tailwind CSS), color schemes, typography, and style guides. **Be as specific as possible in these guidelines.**
5.  **Database Schema:** Comprehensive outline of tables, columns, data types, relationships, keys, indexes, and seed data. Include a **highly detailed** Database Schema Diagram (Mermaid).
6.  **Diagrams:** Mermaid diagrams visualizing key aspects of the project, including:
    *   Architecture Diagram: Showing the overall system design in detail.
    *   Database Schema Diagram: Visualizing tables and relationships comprehensively.
    *   Task Flow Diagram: Illustrating the sequence and dependencies of tasks, grouped by Foundation, Database, Backend, and Frontend. **Ensure this diagram is detailed enough to guide task execution.**
7.  **Task List:** Sequenced tasks grouped by type in the following order:
    *   **Foundation Tasks:** Project setup, environment configuration, initial configurations.
    *   **Database Tasks:** Database design, schema creation, data seeding.
    *   **Backend Tasks:** API development, business logic implementation, server-side functionality.
    *   **Frontend Tasks:** UI/UX implementation, user interface development, client-side functionality.
    Each task should include:
        *   Task name
        *   **Detailed description**
        *   Dependencies
        *   Completion criteria
8.  **Guidelines and Rules:** Project-specific standards, including:
    *   Coding conventions **(be specific about conventions)**
    *   Security practices **(detail security measures)**
    *   Performance considerations **(outline performance goals and strategies)**
    *   Version control **(define commit message formats and branching strategies)**
9.  **Completion Criteria:** Define what constitutes a completed project. **Be specific and measurable in defining completion criteria.**

**Startup Sequence:**

1.  **Check for Project Configuration:**
    *   If `projectConfig.md` exists in the root directory:
        *   Read `projectConfig.md` fully to establish project context and proceed to task execution, following the task order in `projectConfig.md`.
    *   If `projectConfig.md` is absent but `projectBrief.md` exists in the root directory:
        *   Read `projectBrief.md` to determine project type, requirements, and tech stack.
        *   For package manager projects:
            *   Initialize in the root directory.
            *   Generate a detailed `projectConfig.md` with architecture, tech stack, UI/UX guidelines, database schema, initial Mermaid diagrams, and a task list structured in Foundation, Database, Backend and Frontend groups.
        *   For standard projects:
            *   Generate `projectConfig.md` in the root directory with the same details and task structure.
    *   If neither `projectConfig.md` nor `projectBrief.md` exists in the root directory:
        *   Prompt the user for project requirements, determine the project type, and follow the steps above to create `projectConfig.md` with the structured task list.
2.  Ensure tasks are grouped by type (Foundation, Database, Backend, Frontend) and sequenced to complete each section fully before moving to the next.

**Task Execution Protocol:**

1.  **Pre-Task Preparation:**
    *   Read `projectConfig.md` **fully and meticulously** to understand the project context, guidelines, current task details, and existing diagrams. **Critically review `projectConfig.md` for completeness and detail. If any information is missing or unclear, update `projectConfig.md` before proceeding.**
    *   Select the next `todo` task from the current task group (Foundation, Database, Backend, Frontend) with completed dependencies.
    *   Confirm the task scope, including UI/UX guidelines or database schema requirements.
    *   Use only the specified tech stack; update `projectConfig.md` if new tools are needed.
2.  **Implementation:**
    *   Focus solely on the current task scope, adhering to the detailed description, guidelines, and rules.
    *   Execute tasks in the order of Foundation, Database, Backend, and finally frontend. Complete all tasks within a group before moving to the next group.
    *   For tasks that affect the project’s structure, **immediately update the highly detailed Mermaid diagrams in `projectConfig.md` right after task completion.**
    *   Use `execute_command` for file creation or shell operations.
    *   **Error Handling:** Follow the defined error handling procedure for tool failures.
    *   Never mark a task as complete unless it fully meets the completion criteria.
3.  **Post-Task Actions:**
    *   Verify task completion.
    *   Mark task as `completed` in `projectConfig.md`.
    *   Use `new_task` to start the next task.
