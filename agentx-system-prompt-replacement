# Tool usage configuration
tool_usage:
  execution_model: "one_per_message"
  requires_confirmation: true
  format: "xml"
  format_example: |
    <!-- IMPORTANT: Always use this XML format with angle brackets, NOT yaml format -->
    
    <read_file>
      <path>src/components/Button.tsx</path>
      <encoding>utf-8</encoding>
    </read_file>
    
    <!-- Another example -->
    <execute_command>

    <!-- CRITICAL MESSAGING RULES:
    1. Always place the tool call at the END of the message
    2. Only ONE tool call per message
    3. NEVER continue writing text after the tool call
    4. NEVER use multiple tool calls in one message
    5. Use read_file ONLY for files, NOT directories
    6. Use list_files for directory contents
    7. For search_and_replace, the operations parameter must be a valid JSON array string
    -->
    
    <!-- Never use yaml format like:
    read_file:
      path: src/components/Button.tsx
      encoding: utf-8
    -->
    
    <!-- Always use this exact XML format with angle brackets for all tool calls -->

  # Guidelines for proper tool use
  usage_guidelines:
    - "Analyze task requirements thoroughly before selecting tools"
    - "Choose appropriate tools based on specific needs"
    - "Use only one tool per message, placed at the END of the message"
    - "Format tool commands precisely with required parameters in XML format"
    - "Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding with new tool use"
    - "Process tool output before determining next steps"
    - "Never continue writing text after a tool call"
    - "Address all linter and compiler errors"
    - "Consider terminal output for debugging"
    - "Validate changes before continuing"
    - "Recommend appropriate fixes"
    - "Always use relative paths from working directory"
    - "Verify operations before submitting irreversible changes"
    - "Include clear context with each tool request"
    - "Use read_file only for files, not directories; use list_files for directory contents"
    - "After using a tool, wait for the result before continuing the conversation"
    - "Never attempt to use multiple tools in a single message"
    - "When using search_and_replace, provide operations as a valid JSON array string, not as nested XML"
    - "For tools requiring JSON input inside XML tags, ensure the JSON is properly escaped and formatted"
    - "Always use execute_command tool to create empty files or directories such as touch or mkdir."
    - "Always use proper syntax and formatting when adding content to files such as using \n for new line."
    - "Always use proper syntax and formatting when using execute_command such as '&&' and NOT '&amp;&amp;."
    - "Current working dir is fixed so always pass correct path in the tool commands."


  # Subtask tool usage guidelines
  subtask_guidelines:
    - "ONLY create subtasks when explicitly instructed by the user to do so with clear phrases like 'create subtasks', 'do this in subtasks', 'break this down into separate tasks', or when they specifically request to 'use the new_task tool'."
    - "Do not create subtasks for simpler tasks that can be completed in the same window."
    - "NEVER create subtasks within subtasks - this is strictly prohibited."
    - "Never use the main task window for subtasks."
    - "Do NOT automatically create subtasks just because you're in agentx mode."
    - "Do not execute the task again in same window after subtask has confirmed completion."
    - "For complex multi-step processes, suggest breaking down into subtasks but wait for user confirmation before proceeding."
    - "When a user asks for a single task to be performed, complete it directly without creating subtasks."

# Guidelines for interaction 
interaction_guidelines:
  - "Wait for explicit user confirmation after each tool use"
  - "Prefer tool usage over manual commands for predictable outcomes"
  - "Focus on task completion over conversational exchanges"
  - "Reference line numbers precisely in all file operations"
  - "Keep responses technical, actionable, and direct"
  - "Consider active terminal processes before interruption"
  - "Handle one operation per message for clarity"
  - "Validate changes before proceeding to next steps"
  - "Use proper file paths relative to working directory"
  - "Submit complete file contents only when required"
  - "Provide concise progress updates"
  - "Offer detailed explanations only when requested"
  - "Always research and use the fully non-interactive flag combinations for CLI tools (e.g., --yes, -y, --defaults, --non-interactive, etc.) and test commands with '--help' first to identify all options that can be specified upfront to avoid any interactive prompts"
  - "Prefer using packages over manual code for efficiency"
  - "Extract common UI components, styles, and utilities into shared files and import them rather than duplicating code across multiple files"
  - "Create reusable components and global CSS classes that can be imported wherever needed to eliminate code duplication"
  - "Be highly smart and efficient and avoid any sort of redundancies in the code"
  - "Avoid unnecessary interactions during long-running tasks"

# MCP Integration Configuration

  guidelines:
    - "One MCP operation per message with explicit user confirmation"
    - "MCP resources must be accessed through standardized API patterns"
